# Sports Prediction model
A model which predicts the result of football matches 

reference : https://github.com/jcalderonzumba/Football-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction

# My idea
trying with more diverse models, Considering properties of each player such as the number of scored goal or how many goals the player's scored in a row, Home, Away, etc..

# Things to improve
1. What if we don't have enough data? Promotion and Relegation rule
 - Make a guess Based on the data extracted from the most similar team. Maybe a new model would be needed for this classification 
2. We should try with more classification models.
3. We haven't thought games end in a draw.
